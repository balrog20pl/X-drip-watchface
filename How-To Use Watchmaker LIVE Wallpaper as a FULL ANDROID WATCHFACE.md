<b>   NOT INSTALL - Watchmaker LIVE Wallpaper!!!!!!!!!!<b/>

After you have downloaded all the apps, the first thing you do is open AutoApps. This app is there to purchase the full versions of the plugins from Tasker, here you run the AutoTools license for 1.79 €. If the purchase has been successfully completed, you can tell that the AutoTools is no longer grayed out but is now shown in color.
Open Tasker and AutoTools once and please confirm all permissions you are asking for. A request to switch off the battery optimization is also displayed, but usually only when you exit the app with the Back button.
Since you
ALL PRICES ARE FROM 03/17/2020 THESE PRICES WERE NOT COLLECTED BY ME
If you have installed all apps, you basically only have to grant the permissions for Tasker and AutoTools.

To do this, go to Settings, Settings> Apps> Special Access on your smartphone.
Here you will now see several menu items.

Starts at the first, goes through all menu items that I have marked yellow in this picture

Then you have to activate the app specific permissions.

You can do this under Settings / Apps there you will find all installed apps

Finds the previously installed apps from the list and then goes to Permissions. There you activate all switches.
You do that
-AutoTools
-Tasker
-Watchmaker
-Watchmaker live wallpaper


Now open AutoTools and Tasker once and confirm all questions about permissions that are displayed, you should also accept the notification in do not disturb mode, otherwise neither Tasker, AutoTools or Watchmaker can work properly if you have activated it.
You have already activated all permissions in advance, it may still be that the messages are displayed to you.

The apps are now all installed and you can import the Tasker project from me.

Click on the following link, you will be redirected to the Taskernet page in your browser.

Under the description there is a green button "Import" which you press, then Tasker opens and 2-3 messages appear one after the other which you confirm with "Yes".
Now an xDrip icon appears next to the little house. This is the sign that everything has worked.

Here you can see where you activate the local broadcast so that xDrip makes the values ​​available for Tasker, very important !! otherwise nothing works!

here you can read how you can import them into Watchmaker:

    https://github.com/wagnefrede/xDrip-and-AAPS-Notifications-for-TiZENOS-WEAROS-Watchfaces-Tasker-AutoNotification-Watchmaker/blob/master/Watchfaces/README.md

Then read here how the watch faces are imported from there into the Watchmaker Live Wallpaper app:

https://github.com/wagnefrede/xDrip-and-AAPS-Notifications-for-TiZENOS-WEAROS-Watchfaces-Tasker-AutoNotification-Watchmaker/blob/master/Watchfaces/LIVE%20WALLPAPER%20README.md

If you are now back in the Watchmaker Live Wallpaper app, just adjust the size as desired and click on "Save" in the top right and then on Set background image. You can choose whether you want to set up the watchface only for the homescreen or for homescreen and lockscreen.



In the event that you use AAPS and want to use the AAPS status line from xDrip, you can activate the second profile in the Tasker project under Profile and then use this watchface here. Otherwise you can ignore the second profile and the associated task.

!!!!! ATTENTION The AAPS Statusline is not working properly at the moment. Will be delivered in the future !!!!
